# ImageProcessing-Projects

This project focuses on fundamental image processing techniques including:
- **Median Filtering**: Removes noise using a median filter.
- **Noise Reduction** : Reduces image noise using various denoising techniques.
- **Boundary & Filling**: Detects object boundaries and fills missing regions(morphological operation).

Each technique is implemented as a separate module in this repository.
